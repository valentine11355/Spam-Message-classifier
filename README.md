## Approach
-I built a Spam Message Classifier using a simple Machine Learning pipeline.
-First, I cleaned the text data by converting it to lowercase and removing special characters.
-Then, I converted the text into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.
-After that, I trained a Linear SVM model on the processed data to classify messages as spam or not spam.
-The model achieved around 98% accuracy.
-Finally, I saved the trained model and vectorizer and integrated them into a Streamlit app for real-time prediction.

## How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
